## LEARNING PROCESS

### How to Learn Faster with the Feynman Technique

The Feynman Technique is a learning method that involves teaching a concept to someone else in simple terms to deepen your own understanding.

### What was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea in Barbara Oakley's TEDx talk on "Learning How to Learn" is her explanation of the "diffuse mode" of thinking, which emphasizes the importance of taking breaks and allowing the brain to process information subconsciously, enhancing learning and problem-solving abilities. This highlights the value of stepping away from focused work to let the mind relax and make new connections.

### What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

**Active Mode:** Also known as focused mode, it is used for concentrating intently on something, allowing for deep and specific problem-solving and learning.

**Diffused Mode:** This mode is more relaxed and allows the brain to make broader connections, often leading to creative insights and new perspectives. It happens when you're not directly focused on the task, like during a walk or while taking a break.

### What are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? 

- Deconstruct the skill.
- Learn enough to self-correct.
- Remove practice barriers.
- Practice for at least 20 hours.

### What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

- **Set Clear Goals:** Define what you want to learn and why.
- **Break Down the Skill:** Deconstruct the topic into smaller, manageable parts.
- **Gather Resources:** Collect books, articles, videos, and other materials.
- **Schedule Practice Time:** Dedicate regular, focused time for practice.
- **Apply Active Learning:** Engage in exercises, quizzes, and real-world applications.
- **Use Spaced Repetition:** Review material over increasing intervals.
- **Teach Others:** Explain the concept to someone else to solidify your understanding.
- **Get Feedback:** Seek constructive criticism to improve.
- **Consistent:** Practice regularly and stay committed to your learning goals.
