## Active Listening

### What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening?

- **Maintain eye contact**: Establish and maintain eye contact with the speaker, which shows you are attentive and engaged in the conversation.
- **Minimize distractions**: Eliminate or minimize external distractions like noise, phones, or other devices that can divert your attention from the speaker.
- **Avoid interrupting**: Let the speaker complete their thoughts without interrupting them. Refrain from preparing your response while they are speaking.
- **Paraphrase and reflect**: Periodically paraphrase or summarize the speaker's main points to ensure you have accurately understood their message and to demonstrate your active listening.
- **Avoid judgment**: Listen without judging or criticizing the speaker's perspective. Approach the conversation with an open mind and avoid making assumptions.
- **Provide feedback**: After the speaker has finished, provide appropriate feedback or responses to show you have been actively listening and engaged in the conversation.

## Reflective Listening

### According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?

- Showing you understand the speaker's message by rephrasing or summarizing their words.
- Acknowledging the emotions behind the speaker's words, not just the content.
- Encouraging the speaker to clarify or expand their thoughts by reflecting back to them.
- Building trust and rapport with the speaker by demonstrating you are listening attentively.
- Validating the speaker's perspective, even if you may not fully agree with it.
- Creating a safe, non-judgmental space for open and honest communication.

## Reflection

### What are the obstacles in your listening process?

- **Mind wandering**: Getting distracted by thoughts unrelated to the conversation, causing you to miss important parts of what the speaker is saying.
- **Planning your response**: Spending too much mental energy planning how you will respond instead of focusing on listening.
- **Environmental distractions**: External noises, visuals or other stimuli that draw your attention away from the speaker.
- **Emotional triggers**: Having an emotional reaction (e.g. anger, defensiveness) that prevents objective listening.
- **Physical factors**: Being too tired, hungry or uncomfortable physically to give your full attention.
- **Impatience**: Having a hard time listening attentively if the speaker is longwinded or speaks slowly.
