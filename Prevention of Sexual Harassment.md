- Forcing someone to do sexual things  
- Blocking someone’s way  

## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

### If It Happens to You:
- I will say, "I don’t like this. Stop it."  
- If they don’t stop, I will tell my manager or HR person.  
- I will write down what happened. I will write the date, time, and what they did.   

### If You See It Happen to Someone:
- I will say, "I don’t like this. Stop it."  
- I will ask the person who got hurt if they need help.  
- If I can’t say something right then, I will tell my manager or HR later.
