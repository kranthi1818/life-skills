# Good Practices for Software Development

## Which point(s) were new to you?

- Sometimes despite all efforts, the requirements are still vague. So during the implementation phase, get frequent feedback so that you are on track and everyone is on the same page.

## Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

- Make notes while discussing requirements with your team.
- Use the group chat/channels to communicate most of the time. This is preferable over private DMs simply because there are more eyes on the main channel.
